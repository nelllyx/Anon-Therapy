// To create a single therapist:
const newTherapist = await therapist.create(simpleTherapistData[0]);

// To create multiple therapists (RECOMMENDED):
for (const therapistData of simpleTherapistData) {
    const newTherapist = await therapist.create(therapistData);

// DON'T use insertMany() as it bypasses password hashing middleware:
// const therapists = await therapist.insertMany(simpleTherapistData); // ‚ùå This won't hash passwords
